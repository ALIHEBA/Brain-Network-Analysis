4. Correlation Network
The Fr ́echet mean can be used to average the covariance and correlation
matrices for brain network modeling. Qiu et al. (2015) is the first paper
that averaged the collection of brain networks using the Fr ́echet mean. This
requires defining a metric in the space of symmetric positive definite matrices,
which is not a trivial problem. The metric is given by the log-Euclidean
distance (Arsigny et al., 2005, 2006, 2007), which we will study later. The
log-Euclidean framework is often used in averaging diffusion tensor images.
